The echo example implements a simple protosocket application.

It creates a listening socket on TCP port 12345, asks for data when connected, and replies back the data when received. Finally it closes the connection.

Once programmed, connect a node to a serial port of you computer, and run the tunslip program (found in Contiki/tools) as root:
# cd Contiki/tools
# ./tunslip -s /dev/ttyS0 -B 115200 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0

Let this program run. You can now interact with the IP stack of the node.
Test the application using netcat:
$ nc 172.16.xxx.xxx 12345
Where 172.16.xxx.xxx should be replaced by the node IP address, which is displayed on the tunslip program when the node is booting.
