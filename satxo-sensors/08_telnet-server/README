This telnet example implements the Contiki shell application on a telnet server.
It is basically the same as the previous example (shell example), but here the input/output are a TCP connection instead of a serial line.

Compile and flash the application. Run tunslip as before, and connect to the server using netcat:
$ nc 172.16.xxx.xxx 23
