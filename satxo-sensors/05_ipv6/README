This example features a simple application "udp-server" listening on UDP port 3000, and using IPv6. It's a UDP server that waits for incoming messages, displays it on the serial link and send a reply.

The other application "udp-client" sends periodically a message to the server. The server address must be specified in the source file, depending on the node IP address that embeds the server application.

It is also possible to interact with the server from a computer. To do this, refer to the uip6-bridge application README found at: Contiki/tools/uip6-bridge/README
