The multi-threading example shows how to set up threads, and how to use preemption on them.
Two threads are defined, the first implements an infinite loop without yielding. It therefore must be preempted. The second yields automatically after some execution.
Whenever a thread yields or is preempted, the contiki normal execution process becomes running.
